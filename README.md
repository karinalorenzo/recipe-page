## My process

### Built with

- Semantic **HTML5**  
- **CSS** (custom properties)  
- **Flexbox**  
- Mobile‑first workflow  
- Responsive design  

### What I learned

This project helped me reinforce several important concepts:

- How to reset browser defaults using  
  `* { margin: 0; padding: 0; box-sizing: border-box; }`
- The difference between `display: block` and `display: flex`
- How to align lists (`ul` and `ol`) consistently
- How to control text width using units like `ch`
- How to structure a mobile‑first layout and scale it up with media queries

Example of code I’m proud of:

```css
.recipe__description {
  max-width: 27ch;
  margin-bottom: 1.5rem;
}
